Simple HTML tags
There are many tags available in HTML. Here you will learn about common tags that you'll use as a developer.

Headings:
Headings allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
  
Paragraphs:
Paragraphs contain text content.
Note that putting content on a new line is ignored by the web browser.

Line Breaks:
As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the <br> tag. The <br> tag does not need a closing tag.

Strong:
Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.
	No matter how much the dog barks: <strong>don't feed him chocolate</strong>.
	
Bold:
Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.
Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important. Consider the following example:
	The three core technologies of the Internet are <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b>.
	
Emphasis:
Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.
	Wake up <em>now</em>!
	
Italics:
Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.
	The term <i>HTML</i> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
	
Emphasis vs. Italics:
By default both tags will have the same visual effect in the web browser. The only difference is the meaning.
Emphasis tags stress the text contained in them. Let's explore the following example:
	I <em>really</em> want ice cream.
	My favourite book is <i>Dracula</i>.
	
Lists:
You can add lists to your web pages. There are two types of lists in HTML.
Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. List items are specified using the <li> tag, for example:
<ul>
   <li>Tea</li>
   <li>Sugar</li>
   <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
Lists can also be ordered using the <ol> tag. Again, list items are specified using the <li> tag.
<ol>
   <li>Rocky</li>
   <li>Rocky II</li>
   <li>Rocky III</li>
</ol>

Div tags:
A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.
The following example shows a <div> element that contains a paragraph element.
It can be nested inside other elements.
As mentioned, the div has no impact on content unless it is styled by CSS.
Div elements are an important part of building webpages.
